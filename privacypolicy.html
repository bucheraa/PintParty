<h2 id="section1">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
<h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We generally do <em>not</em> collect <em>any</em> personal information about you in the App.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Local-Only Data</strong>: Any data you generate (e.g., your settings, in-App preferences, or local high scores) 
    is stored <em>on your device</em> and is not transmitted to us or any third party.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Optional Direct Contact</strong>: If you <em>voluntarily</em> contact us for support or inquiries (e.g., by email), 
    we may receive your email address or other details you provide. This data is used only to respond to your request and is not otherwise stored or shared.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sensitive Information</strong>: We do not intentionally process any sensitive or special categories of personal 
    information (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, sexual orientation).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>All personal information you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate. You must notify us of any changes to such personal information if you correspond with us directly.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="section2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We process <em>minimal</em> information solely to provide or improve our Services, communicate with you (if you contact us), 
ensure security/fraud prevention, and comply with law.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Provision of Our Services</strong>: Since no personal data is required to use the App, we do not process or transmit personal data for normal gameplay.</li>
  <li><strong>Support/Communication</strong>: If you email us, we may process your email address to respond.</li>
  <li><strong>Vital Interests</strong>: In rare cases, if we must act to protect someone’s safety (e.g., responding to lawful requests), we may process data for this purpose.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="section3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We only process personal information (if any) when there is a valid legal basis.</p>
<p>Because the App does not collect personal data by default, any processing generally occurs only if you <em>voluntarily</em> contact us, 
or as required by law (e.g., responding to lawful requests).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consent</strong>: You may grant consent if you contact us or provide personal info.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We may process data if required by law enforcement or regulatory requests.</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate Interests / Vital Interests</strong>: If necessary to protect vital interests (e.g., preventing harm).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland</em>, we will only process your personal data when we have a legal basis under the GDPR or UK GDPR 
(e.g., consent, legal obligation, legitimate interest, or vital interest).</p>
<p><em>If you are located in Canada</em>, we rely on express or implied consent where applicable. You can withdraw consent at any time.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="section4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We do <em>not</em> sell or share your personal information. We only disclose personal information in limited circumstances.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the unlikely event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal information (if any) could be transferred. We would provide notice of such transfer.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the App does not collect or store personal data, no routine sharing occurs.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="section5">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We do not maintain personal data from App usage. If you provide personal information (e.g., email inquiries), we only keep it as long as necessary.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Default Retention</strong>: The App itself does not store personal data on our servers, so no retention.</li>
  <li><strong>Support Inquiries</strong>: If you contact us, we may keep your information until we resolve your request, or up to ninety (90) days unless a longer period is required by law. Then we securely delete or anonymize such data.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="section6">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We implement organizational and technical security measures, but no electronic transmission is 100% secure.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Because data remains on your device, we encourage you to secure your device (passcodes, encryption).</li>
  <li><strong>No External Databases</strong>: We do not store your App-generated data on any server, reducing breach risks.</li>
  <li><strong>Internet Transmission</strong>: If you communicate with us by email or otherwise, total security cannot be guaranteed.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="section7">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We do not knowingly collect or market to individuals under 18 (internationally) or 21 (in the U.S.).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Age Restriction</strong>: You must be at least 21 years old in the U.S. (or 18 where that is the legal drinking age) to use the App. If we learn a minor is using the App, we will remove or delete that data.</li>
  <li><strong>COPPA Compliance</strong>: We do not direct our Services to children under 13, nor knowingly collect data from them.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="section8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights (e.g., access, deletion, correction).</p>
<p>If you have provided us information (e.g., via email), you may contact us to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request a copy of any personal data we might have.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Ask us to delete it.</li>
  <li><strong>Correct</strong>: Correct inaccuracies.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdraw Consent</strong>: If processing is based on consent, withdraw at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in the EEA/UK, Canada, or other regions with comprehensive privacy laws, please see additional details below.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: We do not currently respond to DNT signals, because we do not track users.</p>
<p>No industry standard exists for DNT, and we do not track user behavior, so we do not respond to such signals.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="section10">10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: Various state privacy laws grant U.S. residents certain rights. We do not sell personal data.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Sale/Sharing</strong>: We do not sell or share personal data.</li>
  <li><strong>Disclosure</strong>: If you believe we hold data about you, you can request details by contacting us.</li>
  <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: Since we do not collect personal data, there is nothing to opt out of, but you can still contact us if you have concerns.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="section11">11. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: You may have additional rights if you reside outside the United States (e.g., EEA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GDPR (EEA/UK)</strong>: Right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, data portability, complaint to an EU/UK authority, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Canada</strong>: Express or implied consent, right to withdraw consent.</li>
  <li><strong>Australia/New Zealand</strong>: Right to access/correct personal data, complaint to local data protection authorities.</li>
  <li><strong>South Africa</strong>: Right to access/correct personal data, complaint to the Information Regulator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we do not actively collect user data, these rights only apply if you voluntarily provided info (e.g., via email).</p>

  <hr>
  <h2 id="section12">12. DISCLAMER OF LIABILITY</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>1. Responsible Use:</strong> This App involves content related to alcohol. You acknowledge that you use the App at your own risk and that drinking irresponsibly can lead to health risks, accidents, or legal consequences.</li>
<li><strong>2. No Medical/Legal Advice:</strong> Nothing in this App constitutes medical or legal advice.</li>
<li><strong>3. Local Laws:</strong> You are solely responsible for knowing and complying with the laws of your jurisdiction concerning alcohol consumption.</li>
</ul>
  
<h2 id="section13">13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
<p><strong>In Short</strong>: Yes. We may update this Privacy Policy to stay compliant with relevant laws or changes in our practices.</p>
<p>The “Last updated” date at the top indicates when this Privacy Policy was most recently revised. If material changes occur, we may provide notice on our website or in-App. 
Your continued use after updates means you accept the revised terms (where permitted by law).</p>
