    <h2 id="section1">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
    <h3>Information Collected in the App</h3>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: Our App <strong>Vacation Tracker</strong> is designed to work entirely on your device and does <em>not</em> collect personal information off-device.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local-Only Data</strong>: Any data generated within the App—such as your continuous location data (collected in the background), geodata extracted from your photo metadata, or manual travel entries (country with start and end dates)—is stored solely on your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Optional Direct Contact</strong>: If you voluntarily contact us (e.g., via email), we may receive your email address or other details you provide. This data is used only to respond to your inquiry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensitive Information</strong>: We do not intentionally process sensitive or special categories of personal information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All information you provide to us must be accurate and up-to-date. Please notify us of any changes if you correspond with us directly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: We process minimal information solely to provide and improve our Services, to communicate with you if you contact us, and to ensure the security of the App.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Provision of Our Services</strong>: Since no personal data is transmitted off your device, all processing (e.g., continuous location tracking, image metadata extraction, manual travel entry) occurs locally.</li>
      <li><strong>Support/Communication</strong>: If you contact us, we process your contact information solely for addressing your inquiry.</li>
      <li><strong>Security and Compliance</strong>: In rare circumstances, if required by law, we may process data to comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: We process personal information (if any) only when there is a valid legal basis.</p>
    <p>Because the App is designed to function without transmitting or storing personal data on external servers, any processing of personal information generally occurs only when you voluntarily contact us, or as required by law.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong>: You may grant consent by voluntarily providing your personal information (for example, via email).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We may process your information if required by applicable laws or regulatory requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate Interests / Vital Interests</strong>: In exceptional cases, processing may be necessary to protect vital interests (e.g., ensuring App security or compliance).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, we process your personal data only when we have a legal basis under the GDPR or UK GDPR. If you are located in Canada or other regions, we rely on consent or legal obligations where applicable.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: We do <em>not</em> sell or share your personal information. Disclosure occurs only in limited circumstances.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the unlikely event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, any personal information (if any) that you have provided might be transferred. We would notify you of such a transfer.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because the App does not transmit or store personal data externally, no routine sharing occurs.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section5">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: The App does not retain personal data off-device. If you provide personal information (for example, via email), we retain it only as long as necessary to address your inquiry.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Default Retention</strong>: Since data is stored locally, no data is retained on external servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Support Inquiries</strong>: If you contact us, we may keep your information until your request is resolved, or for a limited period as required by law, after which it will be securely deleted or anonymized.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section6">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your information; however, no electronic transmission is 100% secure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Because all data remains on your device, we encourage you to secure your device with proper security measures (such as passcodes and encryption).</li>
      <li><strong>No External Databases</strong>: We do not store App-generated data on any remote server, thereby reducing breach risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Security</strong>: If you contact us via email or other methods, we cannot guarantee absolute security during transmission.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section7">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: We do not knowingly collect or market to individuals under the age of 13.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Age Restriction</strong>: Our App is designed for users who can legally operate mobile applications; if we learn that a minor has provided personal data, we will take steps to remove such data.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section8">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights (such as the right to access, delete, or correct your personal data).</p>
    <p>If you have provided us with personal information (for example, via email), you may contact us to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request a copy of any personal data we may have.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Request deletion of your personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Correct</strong>: Request corrections to any inaccurate information.</li>
      <li><strong>Withdraw Consent</strong>: If processing is based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you reside in regions with comprehensive privacy laws (e.g., the EEA, UK, Canada), please refer to additional details provided in this Policy.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section9">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: We do not respond to Do-Not-Track signals because we do not track users or transmit data off your device.</p>
    <p>No industry standard exists for DNT signals, and since all data is stored locally, we do not implement specific DNT responses.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section10">10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: U.S. residents have rights under applicable state laws. Since we do not collect or sell personal data, these rights are limited to information provided voluntarily (e.g., via email).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Sale/Sharing</strong>: We do not sell or share personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Disclosure</strong>: If you believe we hold information about you, you may request details by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out</strong>: As we do not collect personal data off your device, there is nothing to opt out of, but you may contact us with any concerns.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section11">11. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: Depending on your location (e.g., EEA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa), you may have additional rights regarding your personal data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GDPR (EEA/UK)</strong>: Rights include access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, and data portability, among others.</li>
      <li><strong>Canada</strong>: Rights include express or implied consent and the ability to withdraw consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Australia/New Zealand</strong>: Rights include access to and correction of personal data, and lodging complaints with local authorities.</li>
      <li><strong>South Africa</strong>: Rights include access to and correction of personal data, and lodging complaints with the Information Regulator.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the App does not transmit data off-device, these rights apply only to any information you voluntarily provide (e.g., via email).</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section12">12. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Responsible Use:</strong> The Vacation Tracker App is provided solely for your personal travel tracking. You acknowledge that you use the App at your own risk.</li>
      <li><strong>2. No Professional Advice:</strong> Nothing in this App constitutes professional advice (e.g., legal, technical, or otherwise).</li>
      <li><strong>3. Local Data Responsibility:</strong> Since all data is stored locally, you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device and the data it contains.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="section13">13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short</strong>: Yes. We may update this Privacy Policy as necessary to comply with legal requirements or to reflect changes in our practices.</p>

If material changes occur, we may notify you on our website or within the App. Your continued use of our Services after such changes indicates your acceptance of the updated terms (where permitted by law).</p>
