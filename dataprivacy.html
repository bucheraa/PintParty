    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to our App (“Pint Party”), a drinking-game experience designed solely for users 
        who have reached the legal drinking age in their respective jurisdictions. In the United States, 
        the minimum age is 21. If you are under 21 in the U.S. (or under 18 in jurisdictions where 18 is the 
        legal drinking age), do not use this App.
      </p>
      <p>
        By downloading or using the App, you acknowledge that you meet the minimum legal drinking age and 
        agree to this Privacy Policy, as well as any Terms and Conditions governing your use of the App. 
        If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. No Personal Data Collection -->
    <section>
      <h2>2. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
      <p><strong>No Off-Device Transmission:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data 
        (e.g., name, email, IP addresses, or other identifying information) from your device to any remote servers 
        or third parties.</p>
      <p><strong>Local Data Only:</strong> Any user-generated content, game settings, or scores remain entirely on 
        your device. We do not access or process these data points.</p>
      <p><strong>No Analytics / Tracking:</strong> We do not use analytics tools, cookies, web beacons, or other 
        tracking technologies within the App or on our Support Website to monitor user behavior.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. User Age and Eligibility -->
    <section>
      <h2>3. User Age and Eligibility</h2>
      <p><strong>Age Restriction:</strong> You must be at least 21 years old if you reside in the United States 
        (or at least 18 in other jurisdictions, if that is the legal drinking age) to access or use this App.</p>
      <p><strong>Age Verification:</strong> By using this App, you confirm you are of legal drinking age. We do not 
        collect date-of-birth information or other personal details, so you are responsible for complying with 
        the legal drinking age requirements in your location.</p>
      <p><strong>Prohibited Use by Minors:</strong> If we discover or have reason to believe that you are under 
        the legal drinking age, we reserve the right to restrict or terminate your access to the App without notice.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Compliance with U.S. Federal and State Laws -->
    <section>
      <h2>4. Compliance with U.S. Federal and State Laws</h2>
      <p>
        We strive to comply with all relevant U.S. laws, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>State Privacy Laws:</strong> Such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and 
          California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), as well as similar laws in other states (e.g., Colorado, 
          Virginia, Connecticut, Utah). Although most of these laws pertain to businesses that collect 
          personal data, we include this statement to affirm we do not collect or sell personal data.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</strong> Prohibits collection of 
          personal data from children under 13. Our App is not directed to minors of any age; we do not 
          knowingly collect data from minors, and you must be at least 21 (U.S.) or otherwise of legal 
          drinking age to use the App.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Other Federal Regulations:</strong> To the extent other federal laws (e.g., HIPAA, 
          GLBA) would apply, we clarify we do not collect or process sensitive information governed by such laws.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Data Security on Your Device -->
    <section>
      <h2>5. Data Security on Your Device</h2>
      <p><strong>Local Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for securing your device 
        (e.g., using passcodes, encryption).</p>
      <p><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not store any of your user data on external servers, 
        so no data transmission to us occurs.</p>
      <p><strong>No Liability for Third-Party Access:</strong> If your device is lost, stolen, or accessed 
        by an unauthorized party, we cannot be held responsible for local data exposure, since we never 
        have control over, nor access to, your locally stored data.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Support Website -->
    <section>
      <h2>6. Support Website</h2>
      <p><strong>GitHub Pages (if applicable):</strong> Our Support Website may be hosted on GitHub Pages 
        (by GitHub, Inc.). While we do not collect personal data there, GitHub may automatically log 
        certain technical data (e.g., IP address, browser type) for security and operational purposes. 
        Refer to GitHub’s Privacy Statement for details.
      </p>
      <p><strong>No Cookies:</strong> We do not set or use cookies on our Support Website. However, 
        hosting providers like GitHub may use server logs to track performance and security metrics.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Third-Party Services -->
    <section>
      <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> The App is distributed through the Apple App Store 
        (operated by Apple Inc.). Your interaction with the App Store (downloading, purchasing, etc.) 
        is governed by Apple’s own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p><strong>No External Data Sharing:</strong> We do not share, sell, or otherwise transfer any 
        user data to third parties, since we do not collect any data in the first place.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. User Rights (U.S. and International) -->
    <section>
      <h2>8. User Rights (U.S. and International)</h2>
      <p>
        While we do not collect personal data, various laws may grant you rights regarding personal 
        information (e.g., the right to know, delete, correct, or opt-out of its sale/share). Because 
        we do not hold any of your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Requests:</strong> If you believe we inadvertently possess data about you, 
          please email us at the address in Section 10. We will investigate and, if any personal data 
          is found, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Sale/Sharing:</strong> We do not sell or share personal data. Therefore, 
          opt-out requests under laws like the CCPA do not apply.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 9. Children’s Privacy -->
    <section>
      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p><strong>Not for Minors:</strong> This App is intended only for adults who are of legal drinking age.</p>
      <p><strong>COPPA:</strong> We do not direct the App to anyone under 13, nor do we knowingly collect 
        information from them. If you believe a minor has used the App, please contact us so we can take 
        appropriate action, including restricting access.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 10. Disclaimer of Liability -->
    <section>
      <h2>10. Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
      <p><strong>Responsible Use:</strong> This App involves content related to alcohol. You acknowledge 
        that you use the App at your own risk and that drinking irresponsibly can lead to health risks, 
        accidents, or legal consequences.</p>
      <p><strong>No Medical/Legal Advice:</strong> Nothing in this App constitutes medical or legal advice.</p>
      <p><strong>Local Laws:</strong> You are solely responsible for knowing and complying with the laws 
        of your jurisdiction concerning alcohol consumption.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy -->
    <section>
      <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Notification:</strong> Any material updates will be posted within the App or on our Support Website.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Continued Use:</strong> By continuing to use our App after changes take effect, 
          you accept the revised Policy (where permitted by law).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Effective Date:</strong> Check the “Effective Date” at the top to see when this 
          Privacy Policy was last revised.
